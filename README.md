# EtherParticlesGPU.jl
A particle based simulation framework avialable on multi-backend GPU.

> Note: This package is developed and tested on an Intel GPU. Thus, tests should be run on a computer with an Intel GPU although NVIDIA and AMD GPUs should work as well with aid of [`KernelAbstractions.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/KernelAbstractions.jl).
